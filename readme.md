SearchNEU lets anyone easily search over classes, professors, and subjects at Northeastern. All the data on the site is scraped from different parts of Northeastern's websites and updated daily. The scrapers themselves run on Travis-CI and the site is hosted on Amazon Web services. The backend is programmed in Nodejs and the frontend is in React/Webpack. Check out [the documentation](https://github.com/sandboxnu/searchneu/blob/master/docs/Readme.md) for more details.
